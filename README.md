AI-Powered Itinerary Generation
User inputs travel data and preferences.

Front-end calls aiService.generateItinerary() â†’ hits OpenAI/Gemini LLM.

The model returns structured itinerary in defined JSON schema:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "Paris in 3 Days",
  "days": [ { "day": 1, "activities": [...] }, ... ],
  "tips": [ ... ]
}
Validate the structure client-side, store in Firestore, and render.

Testing & Validation
Unit tests: Jest + React Native Testing Library

AI output validation: zod schema ensures response correctness

Manual testing: test itinerary flows with emulator and Expo Go

For CI: Configure GitHub Actions to run npm test, linting, and basic TypeScript type-check

Deployments & CI/CD
Front-end: Built with Expoâ€™s EAS (Expo Application Services)

Distribution: Standalone iOS/Android builds via EAS

Backend: Firebase Firestore and Auth hosted natively

LLM API usage tracked via Firebase Analytics billing monitors

Roadmap & Future Enhancements
 Multi-destination trip support

 In-app flight/hotel booking integration

 Social features: share plans with friends

 Reviews & user ratings per itinerary

 Support for additional map providers (e.g. Mapbox)

 Accessibility improvements (VoiceOver, larger fonts)

 Dark mode & theming
